Prior: Circulating blood LAG3+ CD8+ T cell presence immunotype associated with poor survival

Neighborhood enrichment score for pairs of phenotypes.

LAG3 IC+ = 1% cutpoint, fraction of intratumoral CD3+ cells that are LAG3+

CD3+ LAG3+ intratumoral higher in responders
CD8+ Ki67+ intratumoral higher in responders
CD8+ PD-1+ LAG3+ stromal or intratumoral higher in responders

Scenario 1
    - Select:
        CD3+ intratumoral
        LAG3
    - Compare:
        CD3+ intratumoral AND LAG3
        (CD3+ intratumoral AND LAG3) / (CD3+ intratumoral)
Scenario 2
    - Select:
        CD3+ LAG3+
        CD8+ Ki67+
        CD8+ PD-1+ LAG3+
        CD3+ PD-1+ LAG3+
        intratumoral
        stromal
    - Compare:
        CD3+ LAG3+ AND intratumoral
        CD8+ Ki67+ AND intratumoral
        CD8+ PD-1+ LAG3+ AND intratumoral
        CD8+ PD-1+ LAG3+ AND stromal
        CD3+ PD-1+ LAG3+ AND intratumoral
        CD3+ PD-1+ LAG3+ AND stromal
