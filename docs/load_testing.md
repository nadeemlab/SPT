# Load testing the application backend

Load testing helps to ensure that the whole application is functioning as expected and with adequate performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Recall that you can install the Python package `spatialprofilingtoolbox` in several ways and in different environments:
> - In a virtual environment created with `python -m venv venv`.
> - In debug mode with the `-e` option: `python -m pip install -e .[all]`
> - From PyPI: `python -m pip install spatialprofilingtoolbox[all]`
> - From a local build. Similar to: `python -m pip install dist/spatialprofilingtoolbox-1.0.8-py3-none-any.whl[all]`

A load test procedure is provided as the SPT command:

```sh
spt db load-testing
```

To use it, you'll need access to your backend database from the terminal. The script prompts for database details and the API server you want to test. Typically these are either (i) both on a remote deployment, or (2) both in a local deployment.

The script performs 4 kinds of tests:

1. **Basic API availability**. These assess network connectivity and minimally-correct behavior of the server.
2. **Intermediate-load computation**. This pre-chosen example metric computation request results in only a handful of jobs in the job queue.
3. **Large job-set computation**. This example request is chosen to cause a relatively large number of jobs to be added to the job queue.
4. **Intensive job-set computation**. This example request is meant to test individual worker containers with the largest load they will experience during normal use, but without an exceptionally large number of jobs created.

The report for an example run is shown below. The real report is colorized in the terminal.
