spt-analyze-results
===================

``spt-analyze-results`` is a shortcut to initiating the integration
phase of the analysis pipeline begun with ``spt-pipeline``, even before that
pipeline has fully completed.

The purpose is to make some results available early based on partially-complete
computations.
