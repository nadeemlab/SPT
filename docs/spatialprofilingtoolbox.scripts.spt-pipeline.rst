spt-pipeline
============

``spt-pipeline`` is the main entry point into the SPT pipeline commands:

- ``configure`` . An interactive dialog to solicit configuration parameters
for a run of the spatial profiling toolbox pipeline. The jobs are then
generated and scheduled or run. Configuration parameters are saved to file.
- ``single-job`` . One "job" of one given workflow type.
- ``aggregate-results``. Metric aggregation, outcomes testing, etc.
