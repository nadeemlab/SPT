# Code styling

The following linters should be installed and your code should aim to follow PEP 8 guidelines
* autopep8
* mypy
* pycodestyle
* pylint
* pytest
* any code-friendly spell-checker

We recommend developing in VS Code or PyCharm, but any environment that supports these linters should be sufficient.
