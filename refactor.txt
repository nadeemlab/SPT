1. Make sure PYTHON is only run in special docker shell.
2. Probably don't need separate venvs anymore. Check on DEVELOPMENT_EXTRAS_NAMES and DEVELOPMENT_VENV_TARGETS usage.
3. Might not need venvs at all. Just install into the special docker container; this is isolated enough.
4. Targets involving (somewhere) a step needing to be run in special docker shell:
  - release-package (python -m twine)
  - check-for-pypi-credentials
  - dist/wheelname
  - make build-completions
  - check-for-docker-credentials
  - unit-tests (in each module)
  - module-tests (in each module)
  - build spt-completion
