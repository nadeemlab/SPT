"""
The core of this module takes as input a collection of points, and generates the associated diffusion map and diffusion Markov chain, with the aim of producing features that are characteristic of the input geometry.

Taken as a whole the diffusion analysis pipeline provides statistical test results and figures that assess the efficacy of diffusion-related metrics as discriminators of selected correlates.
