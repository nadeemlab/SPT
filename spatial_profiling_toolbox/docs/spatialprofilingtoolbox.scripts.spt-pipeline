spt-pipeline
============

``spt-pipeline`` is an interactive dialog to solicit configuration parameters
for a run of the spatial profiling toolbox pipeline. The jobs are then generated
and scheduled or run.

Configuration parameters are saved to file. If this saved file is present on
subsequent runs, the interactive dialog is skipped.
