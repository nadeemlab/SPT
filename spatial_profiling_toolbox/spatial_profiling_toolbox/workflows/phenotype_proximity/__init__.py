The core of this module takes as input two collections of points, and calculates the frequency with which a pair of points from the respective collections occur near each other.

Taken as a whole the phenotype proximity analysis pipeline provides statistical test results and figures that assess the efficacy of proximity-related metrics as discriminators of selected correlates.
