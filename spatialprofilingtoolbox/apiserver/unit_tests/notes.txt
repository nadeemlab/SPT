Unit test ideas for API server:

1. Create some boilerplate that spins up and populates a postgres database specifically for testing. This will be handy in many places. This unfortunately is also a test of the import functionality and db schema stuff, violating unity, but that may be necessary.
2. Run one call each for each API endpoint. Do basic checks that the data fed in matches the data read back out.
3. Make a single file out of each test function. This increases the granularity available to the make-based testing UI.

Module test ideas for API server:

1. Substantially re-use the huge list of unit tests, with the difference that they really go to the server in a running container. Support this in the tests with abstracted call.
2. Do some testing of FastAPI, e.g.: the /docs endpoint, the openapi.json, etc.
