This standalone application will provide a rapid visualization of cell locations and
image channel intensities, by slide/field of view, for the purposes of manual inspection
of pipeline results.

By working with processed cell metadata rather than the original images, this
application will achieve greater portability and speed than a full-fledged visualization
platform like HALO.
