# cggnn

This module constructs cell graphs and uses neural networks on the created graphs to predict outcomes of your choice. It is dependent on the [cg-gnn on pip](https://github.com/CarlinLiao/cg-gnn).

## Installation

In addition to the dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`, you'll also need to install platform-specific versions of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html) separately, and ideally [cudatoolkit](https://anaconda.org/nvidia/cudatoolkit) if your system supports it.
