Test ideas

Note that there will probably be a few new scripts here, including:
- spt countsserver status

Unit
1. Mock tcpserver using standard library, to test client.
2. Same, but with some need for sanitization of input tokens.
3. Check read-expression parser against expected response.
4. Start server from test dataset, check 5-10 example queries for response.
5. Using test db provider, test cacher/puller against stored binary representation.

Module level
1. Same example queries, but use Docker container as server instead of local. This involves sorting out mount points.
