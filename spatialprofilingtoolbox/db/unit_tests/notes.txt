Note that there will eventually be a few new utilities:
1. spt db status

Unit tests
1. Fix up the constraint tester to work from container.
2. Test create schema. Check tables and one or two relations.
3. Test create schema views. And drop.
4. In container, test create roles (with interactive aspect).
5. In container, test granting roles.
6. In container, test populating with some test data. Expose result for other tests.


Note on containerization:
The database container is just for development and testing. This is still an important role, as it will be used to support numerous tests.
In the production deployments there is no feasible way to compromise between the statelessness and non-endurance of Docker containers and the need for tightly coupled RAM and persistent disk state for the database.
