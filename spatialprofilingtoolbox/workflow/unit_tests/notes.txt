Unit test ideas:
1. There are ample examples from previous-version tests here to start from. Start by migrating the previous tests (mostly these are "integration" tests in some aspect) into real unit tests.
2. Emphasize the HALO import workflow and the phenotype proximity metrics workflow. The others need to be reworked for DB interaction.
3. Make a single file out of each test function. This increases the granularity available to the make-based testing UI.

Module test ideas:
1. Substantially re-use the huge list of unit tests, with the difference that they really run in the container. Support this in the tests with abstracted call.
