"""
The core of this module takes as input two collections of points, and calculates
the density with which a pair of points from the respective collections occur
near each other, per unit cell area. In an unbalanced mode, it calculates, for
cells of a given phenotype, the average number of neighbors of another given
phenotype.

Taken as a whole the phenotype proximity analysis pipeline provides statistical
test results and figures that assess the efficacy of proximity-related metrics
as discriminators of selected correlates.
